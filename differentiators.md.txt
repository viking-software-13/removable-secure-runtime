# Differentiation Statement

This system differs from existing recovery environments by:

- Treating the host as untrusted infrastructure
- Separating observation from action as distinct trust boundaries
- Enforcing forensic preservation as a primary constraint
- Operating as a cohesive environment rather than a tool collection

The design emphasizes operator cognition, auditability, and containment
over automation or speed.

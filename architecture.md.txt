# Architectural Overview

The system is composed of multiple isolated functional domains operating
under a zero-trust internal model.

### Execution Domain
Provides a verifiable, transient runtime independent of the host OS.

### Observation Domain
Enables controlled inspection of host-resident resources without
implicit trust or modification.

### Correlation Domain
Aggregates and normalizes observations to support operator reasoning.

### Action Domain
Executes explicit, operator-authorized workflows subject to audit and
reversibility constraints.

### Preservation Domain
Ensures integrity, traceability, and immutability of collected artifacts.

Inter-domain communication is strictly mediated and auditable.
